    "The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can we write programs to access text from local files and from the web, in order to get hold of an unlimited range of language material?\n",
    "- How can we split documents up into individual words and punctuation symbols, so we can carry out the same kinds of analysis we did with text corpora in earlier chapters?\n",
    "- How can we write programs to produce formatted output and save it in a file?\n",

Along the way you will consolidate your Python knowledge and learn about strings, files, and regular expressions. Since so much text on the web is in HTML format, we will also see how to dispense with markup."

The main advantage of search engines is size: since you are searching such a large set of documents, you are more likely to find any linguistic pattern you are interested in. Furthermore, you can make use of very specific patterns, which would only match one or two examples on a smaller corpus, but which might match tens of thousands of examples when run on the web. A second advantage of web search engines is that they are very easy to use. Thus, they provide a very convenient tool for quickly checking a theory, to see if it is reasonable.\n",

Unlike local corpora, where you write programs to search for arbitrarily complex patterns, search engines generally only allow you to search for individual words or strings of words, sometimes with wildcards. Second, search engines give inconsistent results, and can give widely different figures when used at different times or in different geographical regions. When content has been duplicated across multiple sites, search results may be boosted. Finally, the markup in the result returned by a search engine may change unpredictably, breaking any pattern-based method of locating particular content (a problem which is ameliorated by the use of search engine APIs)."

    "\n",
    "Our programs will often need to deal with different languages, and different character sets. The concept of \"plain text\" is a fiction. If you live in the English-speaking world you probably use ASCII, possibly without realizing it. If you live in Europe you might use one of the extended Latin character sets, containing such characters as \"ø\" for Danish and Norwegian, \"ő\" for Hungarian, \"ñ\" for Spanish and Breton, and \"ň\" for Czech and Slovak. In this section, we will give an overview of how to use Unicode for processing texts that use non-ASCII character sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within a program, we can manipulate Unicode strings just like normal strings. However, when Unicode characters are stored in files or displayed on a terminal, they must be encoded as a stream of bytes. Some encodings (such as ASCII and Latin-2) use a single byte per code point, so they can only support a small subset of Unicode, enough for a single language. Other encodings (such as UTF-8) use multiple bytes and can represent the full range of Unicode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text in files will be in a particular encoding, so we need some mechanism for translating it into Unicode — translation into Unicode is called **decoding**. Conversely, to write out Unicode to a file or a terminal, we first need to translate it into a suitable **encoding** — this translation out of Unicode is called encoding, and is illustrated below.\n",

    "To the Python interpreter, a regular expression is just like any other string. If the string contains a backslash followed by particular characters, it will interpret these specially. For example `\\b` would be interpreted as the backspace character. In general, when using regular expressions containing backslash, we should instruct the interpreter not to look inside the string at all, but simply to pass it directly to the `re` library for processing. We do this by prefixing the string with the letter `r`, to indicate that it is a **raw string**. For example, the raw string `r'\\band\\b'` contains two `\\b` symbols that are interpreted by the `re` library as matching word boundaries instead of backspace characters. If you get into the habit of using `r'...'` for regular expressions — as we will do from now on — you will avoid having to think about these complications."

    "- The characters of a string are accessed using indexes, counting from zero: `'Monty Python'[0]` gives the value `M`. The length of a string is found using `len()`.\n",
    "- Substrings are accessed using slice notation: `'Monty Python'[1:5]` gives the value `onty`. If the start index is omitted, the substring begins at the start of the string; if the end index is omitted, the slice continues to the end of the string.\n",
    "- Strings can be split into lists: `'Monty Python'.split()` gives `['Monty', 'Python']`. Lists can be joined into strings: `'/'.join(['Monty', 'Python'])` gives `'Monty/Python'`.\n",
    "- We can read text from a file `input.txt` using `text = open('input.txt').read()`. We can read text from `url` using `text = request.urlopen(url).read().decode('utf8')`. We can iterate over the lines of a text file using `for line in open(f)`.\n",
    "- We can write text to a file by opening the file for writing `output_file = open('output.txt', 'w')`, then adding content to the file `print(\"Monty Python\", file=output_file)`.\n",
    "- Texts found on the web may contain unwanted material (such as headers, footers, markup), that need to be removed before we do any linguistic processing.\n",
    "- Tokenization is the segmentation of a text into basic units — or tokens — such as words and punctuation. Tokenization based on whitespace is inadequate for many applications because it bundles punctuation together with words. NLTK provides an off-the-shelf tokenizer `nltk.word_tokenize()`.\n",
    "- Lemmatization is a process that maps the various forms of a word (such as *appeared*, *appears*) to the canonical or citation form of the word, also known as the lexeme or lemma (e.g. *appear*).\n",
    "- Regular expressions are a powerful and flexible method of specifying patterns. Once we have imported the `re` module, we can use `re.findall()` to find all substrings in a string that match a pattern.\n",
    "- If a regular expression string includes a backslash, you should tell Python not to preprocess the string, by using a raw string with an `r` prefix: `r'regexp'`.\n",
    "- When backslash is used before certain characters, e.g. `\\n`, this takes on a special meaning (newline character); however, when backslash is used before regular expression wildcards and operators, e.g. `\\.`, `\\|`, `\\$`, these characters *lose* their special meaning and are matched literally.\n",
    "- A string formatting expression `template % arg_tuple` consists of a format string `template` that contains conversion specifiers like `%-6s` and `%0.2d`.\n",
